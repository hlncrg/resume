 \item \textbf{Data Scientist, Yewno Inc., FEB 2016-JAN 2018}
 \begin{cvsublist}
    \item Concept Relationship/Inference Product
        \begin{cvsubsublist}
            \item Created a product that extracts meaningful relationship phrases between concepts 
                    (e.g. the relationship between `scurvy' and `vitamin c') from a corpus of 55,000,000 documents
            \item Included techniques of SVO extraction using reverb-like OpenIE; 
                    relevance filtering with topic distribution KL-divergence measures and W2V distances; 
                    relationship clustering using cliques based on synsets distance and TF-IDF formulation
            \item Optimized pipeline for real-time extraction constraint of under 5 seconds
             
        \end{cvsubsublist}
    \item Word Disambiguation Research
        \begin{cvsubsublist}
            \item Developed method for clustering data confined to a hypersphere surface using coordinate projection
                of a Gaussian mixture model
            \item Showed reduced variance vs. increased cluster numbers and increased mutual information vs. hypersphere dimension
                compared to typical Gaussian mixture model
            \item Trained autoencoder on text data using TensorFlow and clustered hidden vectors to discover word-senses
         \end{cvsubsublist}
    \item Summarization Pipeline/NLP Toolkit
        \begin{cvsubsublist}
            \item Developed re-usable pipeline for extractive summarization and 
                compiled various NLP functions into easy-to-use python library
            \item Retrieve data using AWS DynamoDB, AWS S3, and Elasticsearch.
            \item Employed Luhn, Sumbasic, LexRank, TextRank, and LSA for summarization; 
                discourse parsing and syntactic coherence for independent discourse unit calculation;
                and Rake, OpenIE methods, and TF-IDF for sentence and entity importance.
         \end{cvsubsublist}
  \end{cvsublist}

  \item \textbf{Fellow at Insight Data Science, Fall 2015}
  \begin{cvsublist}
      \item Designed a web app, http://www.bakeAgain.com, that summarizes recipe comments from allrecipes.com to improve recipe results and give overall impression of completed food creation
      \item Deployed frontend using AWS, Flask and Bootstrap
      \item Extracted modification suggestions from recipe comments using NLTK and gensim libraries
      \item Applied Gaussian Naive Bayes (scikit-learn) techniques to comments data to model modifications suggestions to 70\% accuracy
      \item Utilized Multinomial Naive Bayes (scikit-learn) categorization on recipe reviews and movie reviews to extract food-related comments
  \end{cvsublist}
  \item \textbf{Researcher, Applied Physics, Stanford University, 2009-2015}
  \begin{cvsublist}
    \item Implemented computational models of radio polarization of high energy pulsars and connected to data
    \item Wrote ray-tracing simulation code for model polarization for pulsars in C that ran on the SLAC computing farm to create libraries of simulated pulsars
    \item Applied simulated annealing fitting algorithms in C with error calculations for parameters that described the geometrical and emission properties of the pulsars
    \item Analyzed complex polarization data by using in-depth multi-component model for over a dozen pulsars
    \item Used Python regularly for data visualization
    \item Resulted in three first-author publications and four papers from collaborative efforts
